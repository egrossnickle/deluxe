# Deluxe

Deluxe is a lightweight plugin for jQuery/Zepto designed to mimic the speed and usability of off-canvas navigation schemes found in popular mobile apps like Facebook and Path. Its small size and compatibility with the mobile-friendly framework, Zepto, make it ideal for responsive websites. Silky-smooth touch-based interactions (see [demo video](http://vine.co/v/bJErKLv7IgH)) enhance the experience on touch-enabled devices. And implementation is quick and easy—the plugin will generate the HTML structure and CSS it needs leaving only the visual styling to you.

**Demos and more documentation to come.** In the meantime, see it implemented in the mobile and tablet layouts at [Bust Out Solutions](http://bustoutsolutions.com).

## Requirements

[jQuery](http://jquery.com) or [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com)
* __jQuery__ — Any relatively recent version should be sufficient.
* __Zepto__ — Version 1.0+ is required. As of 3/28/2013, to obtain 1.0+ you must build it from the source. (The copy available directly on zeptojs.com is 1.0rc1 which doesn't qualify.) A pre-compiled copy of 1.0 is available in the `lib` folder for your coding convenience.

## Usage

Target your desired navigation element, for example:

	$('#header nav').deluxe()

For all available options, see `src/deluxe.js`.
